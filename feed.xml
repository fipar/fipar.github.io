        <title>My org-mode workflow</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18891069&quot;&gt;recent Hacker News discussion&lt;/a&gt; inspired me to write a short post on my org-mode workflow, with the hope that it may help others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I like the most about org-mode is that it supports heavy customization. This is not surprising, since Emacs itself is all about customization. You don&amp;#39;t just use an editor, you build the editor you want using this Text Editing Framework, so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to emacs precisely because of org-mode, after enough people recommended it. I came from vim and the first turn-down for me where the keyboard shortcuts. I partially improved that by using evil-mode, which in my view gives you the best of two worlds: the power of Emacs and the ergonomics of VIM. That is, of course, if you think VIM is an ergonomic text editor (I do). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second huge improvement to the usability of Emacs (and org-mode) for me came via the Hyper key. I have written about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://fernandoipar.com/emacs/notes/2018/01/02/emacs-hyper-key.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; and while my setup has changed a bit since that was written, the idea still holds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue keyboard and combined with heavy use of the Hyper key (all but 7 keys on my keyboard are currently mapped as hyper key shortcuts!) and slight typing changes (Never use the pinky for Shift, remap Caps-Lock as Control, that kind of thing), I can spend my typing time without incurring in physical pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So enough for the intro, here&amp;#39;s how I use org-mode to manage my work and personal life: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Capture templates and a global Inbox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use org-mode&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html&quot;&gt;capture templates&lt;/a&gt; to create new entries whenever I need to get something off my head but without losing track of it. Typically that means creating follow-up To Do items after checking my email, getting a new ticket assigned to me, etc. This lets me go through my backlog at the start of the day (I have a daily &amp;quot;check-in&amp;quot; routine for this) and triage every item in the queue to make sure I don&amp;#39;t drop the ball on anything that&amp;#39;s urgent, while still allowing me not to waste mental space trying to track all tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When going through the backlog, I classify things in three categories: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I can do right now because I expect it to be fast. &amp;quot;Fast&amp;quot; is a subjective concept here. I never read the book, but from talking with others that have, my approach is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt;, and I believe the author sets the threshold at something that takes 5 minutes or less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I don&amp;#39;t need to do right now but I must do at some specific time. Things with a deadline. These go to a ToDo entry that is scheduled and has a deadline (Going back to my comment about shortcuts, I have Hyper keys setup to do both these things). It&amp;#39;s important to set this properly so that I can feel confident that once I&amp;#39;m done with the capture process, I can move on to the next item in the backlog and forget about this one, while still knowing I won&amp;#39;t drop the ball on it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I would like to do eventually, would be nice if I do, etc. Things that fall in this category tend to be ideas to improve a project, write a blog post, learn something new. Stuff I&amp;#39;d like to remember as &amp;quot;I would love to do this Some Day&amp;quot; but that is not time sensitive. I typically go to these items whenever I&amp;#39;m stuck, or I find myself procrastinating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, my capture templates go to the global Inbox. This is a heading in my Todo.org file. I&amp;#39;ll talk more about files in the next section but for now what matters is that I will usually refile items to their file, or to their header in the global one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of this process, I have a better picture of how my day (and upcoming days) will look like, and I can plan how to tackle it accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My org files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I have a Todo.org file, which I call my &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; file. It holds my Inbox, my Personal heading (where I file anything personal that doesn&amp;#39;t merit a file of its own) and a Trashcan. I borrowed the idea of a Trashcan for ideas as opposed to just deleting the &amp;quot;bad ones&amp;quot; right away from Robert Pirsig&amp;#39;s description of his workflow in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lila:_An_Inquiry_into_Morals&quot;&gt;Lila&lt;/a&gt;. He used cards and my analogy is an org-mode heading (or subheading, etc) is the equivalent to one of his cards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides this, I have some things in their own org file. Examples include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community.org to track work on community contributions, including ideas of the &amp;quot;would be nice to do&amp;quot; type, but also work with (usually soft) deadlines on bug reports and blog posts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One file per each large-enough project I&amp;#39;m involved in at the moment, and/or for each active client. When going through my email, if I have a request from a client, after capturing it I will refile it to the appropriate file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-demand ephemeral files for things that I need on the spot. Say I need to hop on a call on short notice. I used to add a headline to an existing file and work there. Now I just create a file only for this, work there, and if needed, refile whatever is important to another place when the call is done. Otherwise, it&amp;#39;s easy to move the file to the Attic and be done with it. One of the goals of my setup is that I can both minimize &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot;, which I define as things that I don&amp;#39;t need and clutter my attention, while still letting me keep track of where I&amp;#39;ve been (something important so you have a decent chance of getting to where you&amp;#39;re going). I refer to this exit-target as Attic instead of Trashcan because I typically don&amp;#39;t delete things, unless I&amp;#39;m done with a client and the contract requires that I remove all information about this. Otherwise, having a history of my work as back as I have been doing it is quite useful to plan new things. Org-mode is all about text files so with today&amp;#39;s drives, there&amp;#39;s no way you can ever have disk-space problems because you have too many org files. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My snippets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make use of snippets (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet&quot;&gt;yasnippet&lt;/a&gt;) to help me work faster and avoid errors in repetitive work, but also to keep track of my steps. 
Specifically, on this last item, I have a &amp;#39;tsnow&amp;#39; snippet that expands to the current timestamp (date + time) and when working on a case (say, a bug report), I will create an org header with a brief description of what I&amp;#39;m doing and then invoke the snippet. This creates a worklog that I can go back to when needed and is immensely helpful to me, especially if I need to interrupt my work for some time and then go back to it. When this happens, I also create a special log header called &amp;quot;Status at &amp;lt;tsnow&amp;gt;&amp;quot; where I do a short brain dump of what I&amp;#39;ve found so far and what I think my next steps should be. A nice side effect is that I can export the worklog in plain text (or HTML or PDF too) and upload it to a ticketing system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within each timestamped header I also make use of snippets to create EXAMPLE and SRC blocks as needed, to include code snippets and console output of what I have been doing. For more info on these type of blocks, I refer you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-source-code.html&quot;&gt;the fine manual&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite often, these worklogs become narratives with code interweaved. I like to think of this as &amp;quot;Literate Troubleshooting&amp;quot;, but that may be just because I am a heavy Knuth fan :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Agenda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Org provides an agenda view and while by default it works fine, I have a custom view that shows me anything that is scheduled for today (or for another day in the week, in the weekly view) in the IN PROGRESS, TODO, and SCHEDULED states. In org mode, headers can have a state, and those are useful to &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/guide/Multi_002dstate-workflows.html&quot;&gt;organize your workflow&lt;/a&gt;. Mine are: TODO, IN PROGRESS, SCHEDULED,DONE, WAITING FOR FEEDBACK, WAITING ON CUSTOMER, SUSPENDED, REASSIGNED, and CANCELLED. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Focusing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While org-mode is very nice to organize your thoughts, tasks, and many other things, multi-header org files can get cluttered quickly. If this becomes too much cognitive noise to you (it does to me at times) I recommend using the focus and widen options. I have each of this assigned to a Hyper key so that I can easily make anything except that heading I&amp;#39;m currently interested in, disappear, and then reappear as needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tracking time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If tracking time is important for you, org&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/manual/Clocking-work-time.html&quot;&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt; will come in handy. I basically run with the clock on all the time, and just have it switch automatically as I go from heading to heading, which is kind of saying from task to ask. Off for lunch? No problem, I just use my &amp;quot;Interruption&amp;quot; capture template before going afk. As a result, at the end of the week, I can get a nice report of where I&amp;#39;ve spent my time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you found this useful, and I hope you give Emacs and org-mode a chance. They&amp;#39;re both beautiful software that can help you get a lot done. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is a good cache hit ratio?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What is a good cache hit ratio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking MySQL as an example: what is a good query cache hit ratio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this, I get over 600 results if I enter that question into Google and limit the results to stackexchange.com. If I change &amp;#39;ratio&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;rate,&amp;#39; that increases to over 3000 results, which makes sense, as most people argue that it&amp;#39;s the rate what you usually want to know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several answers to any of these questions, but I prefer to borrow from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach&quot;&gt;Hofstadter&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance&quot;&gt;Pirsig&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; interpretation of a Zen Koan and answer &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)#%22Unasking%22_the_question&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Mu&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;: unask the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that means to me (and I am aware this is my interpretation of other people&amp;#39;s interpretation of a concept in a culture foreign to them) is that it does not make sense to answer the question given the context. To be more specific, I don&amp;#39;t think a (MySQL query) cache hit ratio can be good or bad. It can tell us something about a workload but nothing more. Additionally, what it tells us is aggregate information about this workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say the hit rate is 60% hits over an hour. It does not tell us which queries were hits and which misses, nor what is the range of response time for a given query fingerprint (to borrow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-query-digest.html&quot;&gt;pt-query-digest&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; term). Without this info, it does not tell us if the query cache is beneficial for the workload or not. The same applies for a hit rate of 90% hits over an hour, by the way, as explained by Peter Zaitsev for memcached in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.percona.com/blog/2010/05/19/beyond-great-cache-hit-ratio/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I think this is not a valid question, at least not in a broad performance optimization/application health check context is that it tells us nothing about the things that actually matter about a database: is work being done at the rate and response time the client (or users) expect? Quoting &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596005276.do&quot;&gt;Cary Millsap&lt;/a&gt;, there are only three acceptable units for (database) statistics that make sense to end users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;your local currency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duration by which you’ll improve someone’s response time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of business actions per unit of time by which you’ll improve someone’s throughput&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cache hit rate is measured in hits by time, which is none of the above because such a ratio tells you nothing useful about costs (or savings), response time or throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Running sysbench-based benchmarks against Cassandra</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is a cross post from &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pythian.com/running-sysbench-based-benchmarks-against-cassandra/&quot;&gt;Pythian&amp;#39;s blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently discussing benchmarking options for Cassandra with some colleagues and given my background with MySQL, sysbench was the first tool I thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sysbench is a high performance and flexible benchmark tool that can be used to run both Database and Operating System based experiments. In case you’re not familiar with it, there’s an excellent introduction to it by my colleague Martin Arrieta here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about this tool is that while it includes out of the box support for MySQL and PostgreSQL, it uses Lua for scripting so other databases can be supported provided there’s a Lua driver for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, that means my quest for a way to run sysbench against Cassandra started with the search for a Cassandra Lua driver, which led me to https://github.com/thibaultcha/lua-cassandra&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next task was looking for a simple way to deploy benchmark clients without the need to install dependencies on the host OS. These days my answer to that involves Docker and what I found for this was a handy image from Severalnines: https://hub.docker.com/r/severalnines/sysbench/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image was a good starting point but did not fully support my use case as I need to install custom Lua modules on the container, which requires installing some additional packages on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my full stack for this is Open Source I went ahead and modified the Dockerfile for this image to add what I needed.
I felt this was a change that could benefit others too as I’m probably not the only one using sysbench to run experiments against databases that don’t have a driver bundled with it, so I submitted the following PR which has been merged already: https://github.com/ashraf-s9s/sysbench-docker/pull/1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, I can now launch sysbench against a Cassandra cluster to test the performance of different schemas and workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a simple example let’s consider the following Lua script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;    #!/usr/bin/env sysbench

    function event()
    local cassandra = require &amp;quot;cassandra&amp;quot;

    local peer= assert(cassandra.new {
    host = &amp;quot;172.17.0.2&amp;quot;,
    port = 9042,
    keyspace = &amp;quot;test&amp;quot;
    })

    assert(peer:connect())

    assert(peer:execute(&amp;quot;select * from user&amp;quot;))
    peer:close()
    end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of comments about the script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;172.17.0.2 is the IP address of the Cassandra node I want to connect to. In my case, this is another container, but be sure to change this as needed if you want to reproduce this test (or refer to this gist to see how I ran mine).
For the script to work, the Cluster must have a ‘test’ keyspace with a ‘user’ table on it (as you can see from the query, the table structure does not matter here).
We can use sysbench to execute it via docker like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;    telecaster:sysbench-docker fipar$ docker run -v ~/src/:/src/ --name=sb -it severalnines/sysbench bash -c &amp;#39;luarocks install lua-cassandra --local; luarocks install luasocket --local; /src/tmp/benchmark1.lua run&amp;#39;
    Warning: The directory &amp;#39;/root/.cache/luarocks&amp;#39; or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing /usr/local/lib/luarocks/rocks/luarocks/2.4.3-1/bin/luarocks with sudo, you may want sudo&amp;#39;s -H flag.

    Running the test with following options:
    Number of threads: 1

    Initializing worker threads...

    Threads started!


    General statistics:
    total time:                          10.0017s
    total number of events:              2792

    Latency (ms):
        min:                                    2.17
        avg:                                    3.57
        max:                                   48.12
        95th percentile:                        4.65
        sum:                                 9958.60

    Threads fairness:
    events (avg/stddev):           2792.0000/0.00
    execution time (avg/stddev):   9.9586/0.00
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see I am installing the required Lua modules when starting the container. If a benchmark will be executed several times (which is usually the case) a better approach would be to further customize the Dockerfile to include the necessary modules. I have not done that in the PR though because I think that would bloat the existing image. You can also see that I’m making my machine’s src directory available on the container via the -v ~/src/:/src/. That’s why I can then execute the script from /src/ on the container. Be sure to adjust this as needed to point to a directory tree where the lua script can be found on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, if you have benchmarking needs and have not considered sysbench, don’t be put off if your database of choice is not listed as supported: as long as there’s a Lua driver for it there’s a good chance that you will be able to use sysbench for the task!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Measuring the potential overhead of pmm-client on MySQL workloads</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is a cross post from &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pythian.com/measuring-potential-overhead-pmm-client-mysql-workloads/&quot;&gt;Pythian&amp;#39;s blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having good historial metrics monitoring in place is critical for properly operating, maintaining and troubleshooting database systems, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html&quot;&gt;Percona Monitoring and Management&lt;/a&gt; is one of the options we recommend to our clients for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common concern among potential users is how using this may impact their database’s performance. As I could not find any conclusive information about this, I set out to do some basic tests and this post shows my results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, let me describe my setup. I used the following Google Cloud instances:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One 4 vCPU instance for the MySQL server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One 2 vCPU instance for the sysbench client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One 1 vCPU instance for the PMM server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Percona Server 5.7 and PMM 1.5.3 installed via Docker. Slow query log was enabled with long&lt;em&gt;query&lt;/em&gt;time set to 0 for all tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran sysbench with 200k, 1M and 10M rows using the legacy oltp script with the pareto and special distributions, and up to 64 client threads. After several runs and reviews of the results, I settled on 1M rows with pareto for extended tests, as other combinations showed minor variations on the results from this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am well aware a synthetic workload is not representative but I think the results are still useful, though I would love to measure this on a real life workload (do let me know in the comments if you have done this already).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, I found some impact in performance (measured as throughput in transactions per second) when running sysbench with the PMM exporters which in my case was eliminated when I configured them to serve their metrics by HTTP instead of HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following graph shows box plots for throughput for pmm enabled or disabled, for a different number of threads, with and without ssl:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Boxplot-pmm-client-overhead.png&quot; alt=&quot;throughput with pmm enabled or disabled, per threads, with and without ssl&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that with SSL enabled there is a noticeable drop in throughput when the exporters are running, while this is not the case when SSL is disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the conclusion that it was worth repeating the tests with SSL disabled after creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph&quot;&gt;Flame Graphs&lt;/a&gt; from perf captures during sample runs. On them, the only significant increases were due to the exporters (mysqld&lt;em&gt;exporter and node&lt;/em&gt;exporter, the qan exporter did not have any noticeable impact during my tests). The results from the tests show that this analysis pointed me in the right direction so while they are worth of separate blog posts, it is worth to at least recommend our readers to get familiar with this performance analysis tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is a scatter plot of throughput over time with ssl enabled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/with-ssl-pareto-1000000-plot.png&quot; alt=&quot;throughput per threads, pmm enabled or disabled, with ssl&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On it we get a more clear picture of the impact of having the exporters running during the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is the same graphs but with SSL disabled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/without-ssl-pareto-1000000-plot.png&quot; alt=&quot;throughput per threads, pmm enabled or disabled, without ssl&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is much more difficult to differentiate the runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is confirmed if we look at the 99 percentile of throughput for each case (here for 32 threads):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 90%; cell-padding: 2px; border: 2px solid black; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=&quot;%9b9b9b&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PMM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tps (p99)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=&quot;%efefef&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;enabled&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;enabled&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;1167.518&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;enabled&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;1397.397&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=&quot;%efefef&quot;&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;border: 0px solid black;&quot;&gt;1429.097&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
PMM is a very good Open Source option for monitoring but as every instrumentation and monitoring layer you add to your stack, it won’t come for free. My very simple tests show that its impact may be significant under some scenarios, yet if it’s bad enough it may be mitigated by using HTTP instead of HTTPS for the exporters. Given the events that are unfolding in IT security as I type this, it may seem reckless to recommend disabling SSL as an “optimization”, but I think good engineering is all about informed tradeoffs and if you’re running this on a secure private network, how risky is it to expose monitoring metrics over HTTP instead of HTTPS? I would love to read answers to this question in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I think a similar cost is probably paid for the TLS layer on the pmm-server end. It would be very interesting to see an experiment like this repeated but on a different scenario: one pmm-server with several monitored clients.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Expanding your keyboard on emacs with the Hyper key</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently stumbled upon the hyper and super keys on emacs &lt;a href=&quot;http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_hyper_super_keys.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I like about this setup is that I rarely use the Function key in my day to day usage, so this is making good use of a key that&amp;#39;s both mostly unused and conveniently located in my keyboard, to the effect of running potentially complex tasks (like exporting the currently selected org mode subtree to a pdf and opening it) with just two keys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/emacs-hyper-key.png&quot; alt=&quot;Because every blog post needs a Featured Image&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my current configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;;; hyper key shortcuts: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_hyper_super_keys.html

(defun open-ansi-term-localhost ()
(interactive)
(ansi-term &amp;quot;/bin/bash&amp;quot; &amp;quot;localhost&amp;quot;))

(global-set-key (kbd &amp;quot;H-t&amp;quot;) &amp;#39;open-ansi-term-localhost)
;; C-c C-e C-s l o  export current subtree to latex pdf and open

;; eval lisp
(global-set-key (kbd &amp;quot;H-z&amp;quot;) &amp;#39;org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something interesting here is that the target can be a function or another keyboard combination. The latter is useful if you can&amp;#39;t easily find the function you want, or if you want to pass arguments along with it, like I am doing in my org export shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for how to keep up with the growing amount of hyper key based shortcuts, I am using the old school technology of little sticker labels with a descriptive text on each key. It&amp;#39;s cheap and works wonders until I build the corresponding muscle memory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing groundbreaking for seasoned emacs users but I thought it could be useful to newbies such as myself (I have been using the editor in one form or another for several years already, but with evil-mode, and using only a small subset of its features). &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Opening urls from emacs using Google Chrome on MacOS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently broke my emacs (aquamacs) setup. Fixing it was a very good learning experience that showed me how little I knew about how it actually worked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of that process, I transitioned from aquamacs (a great project to which I made a small donation at some point) to just plain emacs. The big goal here is that since I spent most of my time in a text editor, I would like to be able to easily migrate myself to another platform supported by emacs with little need to adjust my habits (this has become an important requirement should I ever decide that Macs move too far away from the needs of users like me that I decide to switch back to FreeBSD or GNU/Linux).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t document the whole thing here, but I thought one little nugget of duck-tape-fixing was worth of making my blog-post-of-the-year on my personal blog, so here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use Google Chrome for work as we have some customizer scripts that don&amp;#39;t work in Safari.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not want to make Chrome my default browser as I still use Safari for any browsing that does not involve my work email or my work&amp;#39;s ticketing system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My way to achieve this is by this emacs config line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;(setq browse-url-browser-function &amp;#39;browse-url-chromium)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That requires the &amp;#39;chromium&amp;#39; command to be available on your path.
Now, at some point in the recent past, after a minor OS upgrade, emacs stopped being able to open URLs. After some digging, I tracked this down to the chromium command failing with this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;stratocaster:bin fipar$ chromium http://localhost
dlopen /usr/local/bin/../Versions/65.0.3295.0/Chromium Framework.framework/Chromium Framework: dlopen(/usr/local/bin/../Versions/65.0.3295.0/Chromium Framework.framework/Chromium Framework, 261): image not found
Abort trap: 6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted reinstalling chromium (available on mac via homebrew or as a nightly build) but neither approach worked. After some thought, I realized I only need this so that emacs can open urls in Google, I don&amp;#39;t use the chromium command for anything else. With that in mind, my duck tape solution was to create a chromium script somewhere on my PATH with the following contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash
open -a &amp;#39;Google Chrome&amp;#39; $*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That just open the standard MacOS way to open files with a specific application from the command line. Now I don&amp;#39;t have the &amp;#39;chromium&amp;#39; command installed, and I can open urls from emacs using Google Chrome just the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think this is a lazy approach to troubleshooting and that any self respected hacker would have instead spent time figuring out how to resolve the actual error, you&amp;#39;re right. However, life is all about balancing needs and I just can&amp;#39;t spend time tracking down how to fix a problem in a program I don&amp;#39;t really need, so the lazy fix is enough for me at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lesson here for people like my younger past self: once you move into &amp;#39;The Workforce&amp;#39;, tech work is not about solving problems per se, but about adding to your client&amp;#39;s revenue or cutting down from their costs. Doing this effectively requires, among other things, knowing when to stop because a solution is &amp;#39;good enough&amp;#39; for the business need at hand, to the point where the benefits of continuing work on it no longer offset the costs involved.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MySQL can be evil</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, maybe evil is too strong a word, but MySQL can certainly be deceiving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some extent, and in some circles, MySQL still suffers from a bad reputation as a database. In fact, I have personally tried to &lt;a href=&quot;http://fernandoipar.com/mysql/2015/03/11/ongoing-mysql-myths.html&quot;&gt;fight that reputation&lt;/a&gt; in the past. However, I&amp;#39;ll be honest and say that, sometimes, it deserves it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, take the ASC|DESC keyword in index creation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mysqlserverteam.com/mysql-8-0-labs-descending-indexes-in-mysql/&quot;&gt;MySQL 8.0 support those&lt;/a&gt;, thanks for that! But what happens in older versions? Let me quote the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-index.html&quot;&gt;Fine Manual&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;   An index_col_name specification can end with ASC or DESC. These keywords are permitted
   for future extensions for specifying ascending or descending index value storage. Currently,
   they are parsed but ignored; index values are always stored in ascending order.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty clear, and obvious to anyone who has been working with MySQL enough time. We just have this kind of knowledge almost built-in. So built-in, in fact, that it never occurred to me to check what happens when you create an index that way. So I put myself in the shoes of a DBA coming into MySQL from another engine today, and here&amp;#39;s what our DBA would see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;   mysql&amp;gt; create index index_t_on_y on t(y desc);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
   Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it. Not even a warning, and our DBA is left with the impression that, since the create index statement succeeded, producing no errors and no warnings, then a descending ordered index on y was created on table t. And we know how that impression will end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, this won&amp;#39;t cause anyone to lose data, but still, things like this make me think that, sometimes, MySQL deserves its reputation.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A new name and a wider scope for South America's favourite MySQL-related conference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Next November I&amp;#39;ll once again take the ferry to my neighbour city of Buenos Aires to enjoy two days of learning, networking, and presenting, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dataops.la/&quot;&gt;DataOps LA 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the first incarnation of what used to be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mysqlnosqlcloud.com/&quot;&gt;MySQL, NoSQL, Cloud&lt;/a&gt; Conference organized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://binlogic.com/&quot;&gt;BinLogic&lt;/a&gt; in Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change in name reflects a change in scope, now including Operations, Infrastructure and Development tracks, besides the familiar Database one (with lots of MySQL content, but other systems covered too!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agenda is not yet confirmed and, in fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dataops.la/callforpapers.php&quot;&gt;Call for Papers&lt;/a&gt; is open, so if you want and can afford to go, I encourage you to submit proposals. Of course, if you also want and can afford to sponsor, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dataops.la/sponsors.php&quot;&gt;a few plans&lt;/a&gt; available, and I would encourage you to do so too. I am personally very happy that, once again, Percona is supporting this project this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing old friends and making new ones in this wide (and growing) community we have!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Some thoughts on org-mode/babel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#39;ve been playing around with mongodb, specifically with the idea of having a script to summarize data that could be useful to have when troubleshooting, in a way like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.1/pt-mysql-summary.html&quot;&gt;Percona Toolkit&amp;#39;s pt-mysql-summary&lt;/a&gt; works for MySQL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrelated to this, I have been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/&quot;&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt; to, well, organize my work, for a few years now. As part of my day to day job I write a lot of code snippets, usually in bash or SQL, sometimes in other languages, and for this I make heavy use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/manual/Working-With-Source-Code.html#Working-With-Source-Code&quot;&gt;code blocks&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, this has become one of my favourite org-mode&amp;#39;s features, as it lets me keep code relevant to a customer issue on the same place as other information (like output from that code, output from text files, stack traces, notes from my calls with the customer, etc). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to mongodb and my desire to work on some basic tools as a learning opportunity, I saw this as a good chance for trying to do some programming in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literateprogramming.com/&quot;&gt;literate&lt;/a&gt; style. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first tests can be seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fipar/playground/blob/master/tools-for-mongodb/mongo-summary.org&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I understand completely this is a very small and simple project that is not the best to expose the potential benefits of this approach to programming, but it is what I can do now given my work/personal life obligations. It is my goal to start working on something bigger on the personal side, and I plan to use a similar approach to it, so I may know more after that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, one benefit I have already been able to appreciate is that literate programming with org-mode shines when your project combines different languages. If you look at the test functions, like the test for a sharded cluster of replica sets, you can see how org-mode lets me interweave bash and javascript as I explain what I am trying to achieve, in a way that&amp;#39;s independent of how the code will be tangled (as each block will go to a file for the corresponding language). One benefit of this is improved readability (as the alternative would be to have cross-comments in the js and bash scripts, which I think would be less clear to follow), but another, potentially even bigger benefit, IMO, is that this makes it easier to combine different languages in a same project, which gives you more reasons to try and use the best tool for each job. If you don&amp;#39;t need to generate a distributable &amp;#39;executable&amp;#39; project (as is my goal here, I want people to be able to just run the generated code using the wrappers), then org-mode gives you even more features to combine different languages, by using result blocks associated with code blocks. I don&amp;#39;t have a personal example for this right now, but you can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/manual/Evaluating-code-blocks.html#Evaluating-code-blocks&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Migrating to jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of service, my wordpress installation was compromised sometime last week, with all php files replaced by a link to some external site. 
I estimate losses on my part to about $.01, but the impact on my reputation may be more difficult to quantify! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was meaning to migrate to some static site generator based workload, since I don&amp;#39;t have time to be up to date on wordpress updates, security patches, etc, and I guess this provided the ideal opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most posts are back online, with redirects to maintain the original urls, and I&amp;#39;m in the process of importing comments into disqus (so none are showing at the time of writing this). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that much people care, but I expect to be back to normal in a few days, including recovering all comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;

                <p>I've created a short page for <a href="https://fernandoipar.com/recruiters/">recruiters</a> too, and <a href="https://fernandoipar.com/presentations/">here's</a> where I keep links to some of my presentations.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>MySQL performance analysis and optimization (independently, at Percona, and at Pythian)</li>
                    <li>Tooling for MongoDB and MySQL</li>

                <summary><b>Emacs</b></summary>
                <p>The journey to emacs proficiency is a lifetime one, and it includes developing the skill of knowing when you've customized it enough.</p>
                <p>My first recommendation is to read the <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/">book</a> Mastering Emacs and to make it a habit to check <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/">Sacha Chua's blog</a>, which is a treasure trove of all things Emacs.</p>
                <p>My second recommendation is that you try <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>, as it's one of the best text-based knowledge organization and task management software out there.</p>
                <p>Always remember emacs is programmable and you don't need to use the builtin key bindings. For years (more than a decade actually) I used evil-mode, which gives you vim key bindings on emacs. I'm now mostly using the default ones for simple things, but otherwise my setup is heavily customized. You can read a list of posts on this topic at the following links:</p>

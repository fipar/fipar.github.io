His work has been noted for its pervasive philosophical pessimism, style, and aphorisms. His works frequently engaged with issues of suffering, decay, and nihilism. In 1937, Cioran moved to the Latin Quarter of Paris, which became his permanent residence, wherein he lived in seclusion with his partner, Simone Bou√©.</li>

</ul>
<p>
This is largely a discoverability problem1. The solution the Internet has settled on seems to be ‚ÄúEmacs distributions‚Äù like Doom, Spacemacs or Prelude that glue together dozens (sometimes hundreds) of addons to deliver a batteries included, finely tuned and user-friendly experience from first launch. While it‚Äôs not for me, this does work great¬†2, and many of these packages will probably make their way into the default Emacs experience in due time.

<li>[[][Software: A Technical History]] - Software history has a deep impact on current software designers, computer scientists, and technologists. System constraints imposed in the past and the designs that responded to them are often unknown or poorly understood by students and practitioners, yet modern software systems often include ‚Äúold‚Äù software and ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù programming techniques. This work looks at software history through specific software areas to develop student-consumable practices, design principles, lessons learned, and trends useful in current and future software design. It also exposes key areas that are widely used in modern software, yet infrequently taught in computing programs. Written as a textbook, this book uses specific cases from the past and present to explore the impact of software trends and techniques. Building on concepts from the history of science and technology, software history examines such areas as fundamentals, operating systems, programming languages, programming environments, networking, and databases. These topics are covered from their earliest beginnings to their modern variants. There are focused case studies on UNIX, APL, SAGE, GNU Emacs, Autoflow, internet protocols, System R, and others. Extensive problems and suggested projects enable readers to deeply delve into the history of software in areas that interest them most.</li>

<li>[[][Hamilton, Margaret oral history]] - In this oral history, Margaret Hamilton describes her life and career in computing. She begins with a discussion of her family background and youth, including family influences, job experiences, and the development of her interest in mathematics at Earlham College. She reviews her first impressions of computing when working as an actuarial trainee. Her first work in programming with MIT professor Edward Lorenz follows, as does details of her subsequent work at Project MAC and the Lincoln Laboratory on SAGE. She reviews her work on the software for the Apollo Guidance Computer in detail, including her work on errors, alarms, software engineering, and her memorable experiences with the Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 missions. Afterward, she reviews her work on errors leading to formal methods for avoiding them, and for control theory more broadly, developing into the Universal Systems Language. She further details the support of this work, and her experiences in creating two companies to pursue it. The interview concludes with reflections on cultural issues in computing, and more broadly.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Negative_temperature&amp;oldid=1077300540">Negative temperature</a> - Certain systems can achieve negative thermodynamic temperature; that is, their temperature can be expressed as a negative quantity on the Kelvin or Rankine scales. This should be distinguished from temperatures expressed as negative numbers on non-thermodynamic Celsius or Fahrenheit scales, which are nevertheless higher than absolute zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The absolute temperature (Kelvin) scale can be understood loosely as a measure of average kinetic energy. Usually, system temperatures are positive. However, in particular isolated systems, the temperature defined in terms of Boltzmann's entropy can become negative.
The possibility of negative temperatures was first predicted by Lars Onsager in 1949.
Onsager was investigating 2D vortices confined within a finite area, and realized that since their positions are not independent degrees of freedom from their momenta, the resulting phase space must also be bounded by the finite area. Bounded phase space is the essential property that allows for negative temperatures, and can occur in both classical and quantum systems. As shown by Onsager, a system with bounded phase space necessarily has a peak in the entropy as energy is increased. For energies exceeding the value where the peak occurs, the entropy decreases as energy increases, and high-energy states necessarily have negative Boltzmann temperature.
A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is hotter than any system with a positive temperature.  If a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system. A standard example of such a system is population inversion in laser physics.
Temperature is loosely interpreted as the average kinetic energy of the system's particles. The existence of negative temperature, let alone negative temperature representing "hotter" systems than positive temperature, would seem paradoxical in this interpretation. The paradox is resolved by considering the more rigorous definition of thermodynamic temperature as the tradeoff between internal energy and entropy contained in the system, with "coldness", the reciprocal of temperature, being the more fundamental quantity. Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system, while systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.Thermodynamic systems with unbounded phase space cannot achieve negative temperatures: adding heat always increases their entropy. The possibility of a decrease in entropy as energy increases requires the system to "saturate" in entropy. This is only possible if the number of high energy states is limited. For a system of ordinary (quantum or classical) particles such as atoms or dust, the number of high energy states is unlimited (particle momenta can in principle be increased indefinitely). Some systems, however (see the examples below), have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. The limited range of states accessible to a system with negative temperature means that negative temperature is associated with emergent ordering of the system at high energies. For example in Onsager's point-vortex analysis negative temperature is associated with the emergence of large-scale clusters of vortices. This spontaneous ordering in equilibrium statistical mechanics goes against common physical intuition that increased energy leads to increased disorder.

<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/sqlite_one-line-csv-operations.md">One-liner for running queries against CSV files with SQLite</a> - I figured out how to run a SQL query directly against a CSV file using the `sqlite3` command-line utility:
</p>

<p>
sqlite3 :memory: -cmd '.mode csv' -cmd '.import taxi.csv taxi' \
  'SELECT passenger<sub>count</sub>, COUNT(*), AVG(total<sub>amount</sub>) FROM taxi GROUP BY passenger<sub>count</sub>'
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
This uses the special `:memory:` filename to open an in-memory database. Then it uses two `-cmd` options to turn on CSV mode and import the `taxi.csv` file into a table called `taxi`. Then it runs the SQL query.
</p>

<p>
You can get `taxi.csv` by downloading the compressed file from [here](<a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/blob/43e72ff1d2c871082fed0ae401dd59e2ff9f6cfe/testdata/taxi.csv.7z">https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/blob/43e72ff1d2c871082fed0ae401dd59e2ff9f6cfe/testdata/taxi.csv.7z</a>) and running:
</p>

<p>
7z e -aos taxi.csv.7z
</p>

<p>
I figured this out while commenting on [this issue](<a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/issues/70">https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/issues/70</a>).

<p>
The output looks like this:

## Other options
</p>

<p>
There are a whole bunch of other tools that can be used for this kind of thing!
</p>

<p>
My own [sqlite-utils memory](<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jun/19/sqlite-utils-memory/">https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jun/19/sqlite-utils-memory/</a>) command can load data from JSON, CSV or TSV into an in-memory database and run a query against it. It's a LOT slower than using `sqlite3` directly though.
</p>

<p>
[dsq](<a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq">https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq</a>) is a tool that does this kind of thing (and a lot more). Author Phil Eaton compiled [a collection of benchmarks](<a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq#benchmark">https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq#benchmark</a>) of other similar tools, and his [benchmarking script](<a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/blob/43e72ff1d2c871082fed0ae401dd59e2ff9f6cfe/scripts/benchmark.sh">https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/blob/43e72ff1d2c871082fed0ae401dd59e2ff9f6cfe/scripts/benchmark.sh</a>) demonstrates how to use each one of them.

<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3517209.3524042">Making CRDTs Byzantine fault tolerant</a> - It is often claimed that Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) ensure consistency of replicated data in peer-topeer systems. However, peer-to-peer systems usually consist of untrusted nodes that may deviate from the specified protocol (i.e. exhibit Byzantine faults), and most existing CRDT algorithms cannot guarantee consistency in the presence of such faults. This paper shows how to adapt existing non-Byzantine CRDT algorithms and make them Byzantine fault-tolerant. The proposed scheme can tolerate any number of Byzantine nodes (making it immune to Sybil attacks), guarantees Strong Eventual Consistency, and requires only modest changes to existing CRDT algorithms.</li>

I'm currently working as a [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/fipar][DBRE]] at [[https://www.life360.com][Life360]].
I've created a short page for [[https://fernandoipar.com/recruiters/][recruiters]], and [[https://fernandoipar.com/presentations/][here]]'s where I keep links to some of my presentations.
[[https://fernandoipar.com/everything/][This]] is the list of all posts from the old blog, and [[https://gnuserland.blogspot.com][this]] is an even older blog, if you have time to waste.
Random list of things I've done professionally:
- MySQL performance analysis and optimization (independently, at Percona, and at Pythian).
- Tooling for MongoDB and MySQL.
- Rebase work maintaining private MySQL branches for the DBaaS product of a Cloud vendor.
- Programming work in Java, C, C++, Ruby, Go, and Python.
- Private benchmarks
- Technical reviewer for [[https://hackmysql.com/book-5/][Efficient MySQL Performance]] and [[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm:978-1-4842-8224-3/1][Practical CockroachDB]].

#+BEGIN_emacs
The journey to emacs proficiency is a lifetime one, and it includes developing the skill of knowing when you've customized it enough.

My first recommendation is to read the [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/][book]] Mastering Emacs and to make it a habit to check [[http://sachachua.com/blog/][Sacha Chua's blog]], which is a treasure trove of all things Emacs.

My second recommendation is that you try [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], as it's one of the best text-based knowledge organization and task management software out there.

Always remember emacs is programmable and you don't need to use the builtin key bindings. For years (more than a decade actually) I used evil-mode, which gives you vim key bindings on emacs. I'm now mostly using the default ones for simple things, but otherwise my setup is heavily customized. You can read a list of posts on this topic at the following links:

- [[https://fernandoipar.com/emacs/notes/2018/01/02/emacs-hyper-key.html][Emacs Hyper Key]]

On [[./content/emacs/emacs_config_notes.html][this page]] I  will try to maintain a short summary of how my emacs configuration is organized.

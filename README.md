My personal site.

This used to be a Jekyll blog using the [mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) theme with
minor customizations. License info for the theme can be found in the
LICENCE file on this repo.

All contents except that theme or otherwise mentioned are Copyrighted by
Fernando Ipar. All source code examples on posts, unless otherwise
mentioned, are in the public domain.

The site is now just plain old html and some images (when required).

It should work well with accessibility features, please file an issue or submit a PR if that's not the case.
